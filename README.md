## Introduction

The increasingly advanced era will bring a large number of motorized vehicles, but if the number of motor vehicles is large, it will cause traffic congestion, environmental pollution and waste of fuel. route. Therefore, many routes will make people easily lost because they are too unfamiliar. According to statistics, the number of motor vehicles increased from 2.3% to 3.9% per year. A substantial number and solving those numbers is the problem that we cannot ban motor vehicles just to avoid traffic congestion because it will cause more economic damage than it can bring about. Motorized vehicles are an indispensable part of human life, they are an important tool for traveling, working, traveling and working. Other activities such as banning motorbikes will cause a great loss of money and time to other activities. When the number of motor vehicles increases significantly, traffic jams will occur because when joining in traffic, one or more different roads must be divided and a large number of motor vehicle drivers must be gathered in one place. This will cause traffic jams, making everyone feel uncomfortable and wasteful. Whether, harm the environment including waste of effort and time, a lot of this always happens on shifts, days off, ... With such a problem raised, I have tried to come up with That solution is to find the shortest route so that people can achieve their goal and avoid the intersection. Each person walking on a single road will help control, avoid traffic congestion, make vehicles can operate more efficiently, faster and will bring a significant economic benefit. because the intersection routes are smooth.
